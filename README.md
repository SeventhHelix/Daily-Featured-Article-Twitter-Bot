#Daily Featured Article Wikipedia Twitter Bot


A Twitter bot written in Python that grabs Wikipedia's daily featured article and tweets it. You can follow it in action here: <a href="http://twitter.com/dailyfeatured">http://twitter.com/DailyFeatured</a>


As of right now, the bot isn't working in full force. The rss feed that I had used to get the featured article is down. I hope to revisit this project soon and get it working again. 

This was one of my first actual projects in Python. It was a bit frustrating at times, but it was fun learning more about Python and the possibilities of the various libraries available for working with Twitter!

After working on my second Twitter bot, the <a href="https://github.com/SeventhHelix/ImgurVaultBot">ImgurVault bot</a>, I've gotten some more experience in parsing JSON and XML using different libraries. This could probably be updated to use those libraries for better readability and maintainability, but I'll leave it for now.


##OAuth
Note: If you'd like to use something similar to this script, you'll have to find the correct credentials for your Twitter account to be able to post to it correctly.
You can find a great guide for setting it up here: talkfast.org/2010/05/31/twitter-from-the-command-line-in-python-using-oauth
